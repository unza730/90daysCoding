The algorithm for the given code is as follows:

1. Start the program.
2. Prompt the user to enter the number of rows and columns.
3. Read and store the user's input in the `num` variable.
4. Start a loop from 0 to `num - 1` (inclusive) to iterate over the rows.
5. Inside the outer loop, start another loop from 0 to `num - 1` (inclusive) to iterate over the columns.
6. Inside the inner loop, print an asterisk (`*`) to represent each element in the pattern.
7. After printing the row, move to the next line using `System.out.println()` to create a new line for the next row.
8. Repeat steps 5-7 for each row until the outer loop completes.
9. End the program.

This algorithm generates a pattern with `num` rows and columns, where each element in the pattern is represented by an asterisk (`*`). It uses nested loops to iterate over the rows and columns and prints the asterisks accordingly.
